# Sim Tower clone
* a construction and management simulation video game

### what?
A "light" version of the fun, addicting tower-building simulation game. Giving users the pleasurable experience of building a classy multipurpose commercial building!

### why?
* First of all, this game is not available for OS X.
* It offers the chance to build and manage all the complex, interconnected operations of a model skyscraper. You build your empire up from nothing and act as the engineer and general manager of your structure.
* Have a great fun time!

### how?
* The game begins with a one-star tower with limited building options. To increase the tower's star rating, it must attract more tenants by providing more living space (or office space, and later in the game, hotel and various commercial space). New facilities are made available while the tower progresses from a one-star rating to a five-star rating.
* Disruptive events can happen to hinder progress.

### tech -
* ruby Sinatra and angularjs
